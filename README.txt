OpenTwinCities Website UX Prototype
-----------------------------------

Description:
This is a prototype for OTC's website that could potentially change drastically over time.

Purpose & Goals:
1. Provide accessibility for developers on design, ux, or front-end aspects of the OTC website
2. Serve as a "living" guideline and reference for OTC's website content, visual design, interaction design, and overall user experience
3. Act as a playground for testing and experimenting of new website ideas
4. Figure out if a designer/ux guy can use github without learning too much dev-related details
5. Figure out if developers will be OK with this use of github to go from prototype to production

Prototype Usage:
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the local directory
3. Open index.html in Chrome (prototype is not necessarily browser compatible)
